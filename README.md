Within the wine industry, the evaluation of wine quality is an essential task. The goal of this work is to develop an end to end machine learning pipeline and evaluate the performance of different models in predicting wine quality using the red wine dataset available in the UCI repository. Results show that all implemented models performed reasonably well; however, the Extra Trees Classifier was the best performing model, achieving the highest F1-score and accuracy. Even when excluding less influential features or applying automated feature selection procedures, the full feature Extra Trees model consistently performed well and even better than reduced feature models. These findings indicate that tree based methods work well with full feature sets and are robust to mild data outliers.
